## Directories

`data`: all finalized, reproducible datasets. `data-raw`: all data that
is work-in-progress. `not_included`: your own scratch directory, not
synchronized to github. `R`: R language scripts `Python`: Python
language scripts. `rsconnect`: rpubs connection files, not synchronized

The main directory has Rmd files, which contain R or Python codes
embedded in the markdown text. Each .Rmd file has a corresponding
subdirectory, such as `Eurobarometer_19_files` for
`Eurobarometer_19.Rmd`. Furthermore, it may have the knitted `.pdf`,
`.docx` or `.html` versions of the Eurobarometer\_19 document. The main
directory contains all `.bib` files for bibliographical references,
please, reference your data sources, too.

Please do not leave scratch, R and Python codes, downloaded data tables
in the main directory.

## Processed Files From 2021

-   [Climate-retroharmonize.Rmd](https://github.com/dataobservatory-eu/sustainability/blob/main/Climate-retroharmonize.Rmd)
    is the actual harmonization code

-   [Climate-regionalize.Rmd](https://github.com/dataobservatory-eu/sustainability/blob/main/Climate-Regionalize.Rmd)
    is the regionalization code

    is an overview of the Eurobarometer data (you find the questionnaire
    documentationÂ links, but they are also downloaded to data-raw.

-   [Climate-join.Rmd](https://github.com/dataobservatory-eu/sustainability/blob/main/Climate-join.Rmd)
    joins your datasets with the newly harmonized, regionalized ones.

They create -

panel data of four surveys.

-   [climate-panel\_recoded.rds](https://github.com/dataobservatory-eu/sustainability/blob/main/data-raw/climate-panel_recoded.rds):
    regional aggregates from `climate-panel.rds`.
